# lovepowerpainWallpaper
a free active wallpaper 

my own html and css and a modified script using @javascriptacademy-stash "digital rain" script as a base code

download the zip. unzip the file and keep it organized.

drag the html or select and drag all the files into a live wallpaper application.

I use the app Lively Wallpaper by rocksdanister. it's free and open source 

enjoy.
